Planning Center Integration for Behringer X32 mixing console

## A brief background
I play in the band at my church's highschool ministry. Previously not much changed as far as mixing (mains, ears, etc) between our sunday and tuesday night services but recently we have had pretty much a completely different band every week. Sometimes we will have a full 6-person band (drums, bass, electric, vocals, keys, acoustic...) and other days it will just be acoustic guitar and cajon. This makes for a lot of work mixing in ears and mains, as well as routing and other setup before every service. For a tech team of myself and about 2 other people, this starts to get a bit impractical twice a week. 

Recently, I had been searching for some library for controlling out Behringer X32 mixing console via OSC when I stumbled on this repo by a church in berlin: https://github.com/cabcookie/saddleback-x32-general-scene. I had found what looked like some code that would automatically fetch data from Planning Center Services about who was playing in the band that week and update the x32 with presets for each person (like their favorite in ear mixes). This immediately seemed like it could greatly help us out with our own services.

Anyways, I'll post any code regarding my progress with this project here.
